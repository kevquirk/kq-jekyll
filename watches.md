description: This page is an evolving list of the watches I currently have in my collection.
---

I have a love for many different types of watches. My collection tends to hover at around 50 watches, so I thought I'd list them out here. As I buy and sell watches, I'll try to keep this page updated.

Here's a rough guide on what the star ratings for all these watches mean:

**★☆☆☆☆ (1 star)** - A bad watch, I should probably sell it<br>
**★★☆☆☆ (2 stars)** - It's okay, but I don't wear it often<br>
**★★★☆☆ (3 stars)** - It's a good watch that I wear regularly<br>
**★★★★☆ (4 stars)** - A great watch that I wear often<br>
**★★★★★ (5 stars)** - Pretty much the perfect watch

For reference, I have a 7.25" (18.4cm) wrist.

  <h2>Casio F-91W</h2>
  <p><b>Case size:</b> 34mm<br>
     <b>Movement:</b> Quartz<br>
     <b>Water resist:</b> 30m<br>
     <b>Strap size:</b> 18mm<br>

     <b>Rating:</b> ★★★☆☆ (3 stars)</p>
  <div class="spacer"></div>
  <p>The F-91W is a fantastic watch - it's cheap, works well and has the basic functions that most people would need. It loses a couple stars for the poor backlight and only 30m of water resistance. I like these watches so much, <a target="blank" href="/assets/images/f91w-collection.webp">that I actually have six of them</a>.</p>

     <b>My rating:</b> ★★★☆☆ (3 stars)</p>
  <div class="spacer"></div>
  <p>The F-84W is very similar to the F-91W, except it was made for the Japanese market. Personally, I prefer the look of the 84 vs the 91 as it has a more 80's aesthetic. The internals are exactly the same as the 91, so it suffers from the same poor backlight and 30m of water resistance.</p>

  <p>I love the yellow accent of the F94-W. I have it on a yellow and grey NATO strap, which (I think) works great. The F-94W has an updated module to the 91 and 84, but it's pretty much the same in terms of features. The backlight is improved, slightly, but the water resistance remains the same.</p>

     <b>My rating:</b> ★★★★☆ (4 stars)</p>
  <div class="spacer"></div>
  <p>A natural upgrade from the F-series of watches that improves the water resistance *and* the backlight (it's a proper illuminator) for not much more money. The design is a little more modern and will work on most people's wrists. It's a great digital watch.</p>

     <b>My rating:</b> ★★★☆☆ (3 stars)</p>
  <div class="spacer"></div>
  <p>I love the CA-53W purely for it's nostalgia as the watch Marty McFly wore in Back to the Future. It's useless as calculator though, thanks to the tiny buttons. And because of all those buttons, the screens is tiny too. Weirdly, there's also no 24hr time on this watch, which is a shame. If it wasn't for the nostalgia factor, I'd be giving this 2 stars.</p>

     <b>My rating:</b> ★★★☆☆ (3 stars)</p>
  <div class="spacer"></div>
  <p>Very similar to the CA-53W, the A100 has huge nostalgia factor as it's the watch Ripley wore in the Alien films. I love the design of this watch, but I always forget which button does what function, as the labels are (stupidly) on the back. I also think it's expensive for what it is. Still cool though.</p>

     <b>My rating:</b> ★★★★☆ (4 stars)</p>
  <div class="spacer"></div>
  <p>I love the A700. It's a classic looking watch that can be worn anywhere. While walking the dog, while out with friends, or even to a wedding. It's so slim that it fits perfectly under a shirt cuff. The screen is also really legible - I love this watch.</p>

     <b>My rating:</b> ★★★★☆ (4 stars)</p>
  <div class="spacer"></div>
  <p>The AE-1200 (AKA the Royale) is a fantastic watch with a TONNE of features, all for £35. It also has 100m of water resistance and a really good backlight. The only reason I haven't given this 5 stars is because I *personally* think it has too much going on with the screen. I have an [SKXMOD](https://www.skxmod.com) metal case, strap and sapphire crystal on this watch.</p>

     <b>Price:</b> £25 ($31)<br>
     <b>My rating:</b> ★★★★☆ (4 stars)</p>
  <div class="spacer"></div>
  <p>A great alternative to the G-SHOCK DW-5600 if you don't want to pay the extra money. It's obviously not as robust as the G-SHOCK, but it's a great beater watch. This is actually the first watch that got me back into Casio a few years ago.</p>
</div>

<div class="watch">
  <img src="/assets/images/watches/w800h.webp" alt="Casio W-800H" loading="lazy"/>
  <h2>Casio W-800H</h2>

     <b>My rating:</b> ★★★★★ (5 stars)</p>
  <div class="spacer"></div>
  <p>The W-800H is pretty much the perfect digital watch, in my opinion. It's cheap, super clear with a massive screen and it looks great. With 100m water resistance, you can go swimming in this thing too. I wear this one all the time.</p>

  <div class="spacer"></div>
  <p>Imagine the F-91W and the W-800H had a beautiful baby. The W-217H would be the result. I **love** this watch. If you're after a cheap beater that's as clear as the W-800H, but a little smaller, this is the watch you should buy. I have this on a custom 20mm silicone strap.</p>

     <b>Price:</b> £100 ($127)<br>
     <b>My rating:</b> ★★★☆☆ (3 stars)</p>
  <div class="spacer"></div>
  <p>This is a slightly more upmarket version of the A700. With a metal case and higher quality strap, albeit a bit of a hair puller. It's a nice watch, especially with the copper border around the edge, but I think it's a little overpriced for what it is. Also, for £100, I'd expect to see more than 30m of water resistance.</p>
</div>

     <b>My rating:</b> ★★★☆☆ (3 stars)</p>
  <div class="spacer"></div>
  <p>This is a big old watch, so probably not for everyone. But if you want a watch that's 90% G-SHOCK for 30% of the price, you should look at the MWD-110H. I don't really wear this watch as often as I should. It's good.</p>

     <b>My rating:</b> ★★★☆☆ (3 stars)</p>
  <div class="spacer"></div>
  <p>Another big watch that's similar, in looks, to the G-SHOCK line up. And, like G-SHOCKs, the DW-290 has 200m water resist. It also has some nostalgic props, being the watch that Tom Cruise wore in the original Mission Impossible film.</p>

     <b>My rating:</b> ★★★★☆ (4 stars)</p>
  <div class="spacer"></div>
  <p>Finally a non-digital watch, eh? Like with most divers, this is a BIG watch, at 44mm. It's heavy too - you really feel this one on your wrist. It's at the upper limit of what I can pull off on my wrist, but it's such great value for money. I have it on a grey and blue NATO strap.</p>

     <b>My rating:</b> ★★★★★ (5 stars)</p>
  <div class="spacer"></div>
  <p>I absolutely love the MRW-200H. The white dial with black numerals and hands just works so well; I love the really high contrast. Although it's 44mm, it doesn't feel (or wear) like one. And being resin, it's really light. Great watch for such a small amount of money.</p>

  <div class="spacer"></div>
  <p>This is the only dress watch in my collection, and I love it. It's slim and looks WAY more expensive than it actually is with the beautiful sunburst effect on the dial. If I'm ever putting on a suit, I'll usually be wearing this or my PRX. I have it on an aftermarket brown leather strap.</p>

     <b>Price:</b> £40 ($50)<br>
     <b>My rating:</b> ★★☆☆☆ (2 stars)</p>
  <div class="spacer"></div>
  <p>I really don't wear this watch as much as I should. I like it, I just like my other watches more. It has a real 90s vintage vibe to it. It only cost me £15 (second hand) from eBay, so I keep it around, otherwise I'd probably sell it.</p>

     <b>My rating:</b> ★★★☆☆ (3 stars)</p>
  <div class="spacer"></div>
  <p>This is a really good watch. Many of the GA2100 range (or CasiOak as they're better known) have poor contrast on the dial, but not this one. I also think the unique marbling on the resin is interesting.</p>

  <p>This is part of the G-SHOCK 40th Anniversary collection, and has a unique strap listing some of the more popular models from the G-SHOCK lineup over the years. This is a nice watch, but it's a bit too big for me, I think, so I don't wear it often.</p>

  <p>Another watch from the 40th Anniversary lineup, and sporting the same strap at the DW-6640RE. This is a take on the venerable DW5600 though. Difference here is that this edition of the watch comes with interchangeable bezels, so it's practically 2 watches in 1.</p>

  <p>Probably the most versatile G-SHOCK in existence. The GW-M5610U takes the DW-5600 and makes it's better. With solar power and automatic time setting, this thing is brilliant. I use it to set the time on all my other watches.</p>

  <p>This is a good watch. I particularly like the minimalist bezel, which is a break from convention for Casio. I don't wear this all that often though, mainly because of the negative display - it makes telling the time difficult, especially in direct sunlight.</p>

  <p>This is a posh DW-5600. It's basically the exact same watch as the 5600, except in a metal case instead of a resin one. I really like this watch - it's super robust and looks great in grey.</p>

  <p>When I first saw this watch, I knew I had to have it. It's absolutely gorgeous. I love the deep blue of the face, coupled with the off-white of the applied numerals and hands. This is the watch that garners the most comments from people, especially on the aftermarket suede strap.</p>

  <p>This is a fantastic little field watch that I wear all the time. I do like smaller watches, so being 37mm works really well. I don't think it looks too small on my wrist, either. These are cheap automatics, but the Seiko 5 series are really well built.</p>

  <p>The big brother of the SNK805K2. I love how clear this watch is to read and how good the lume is on it. The brushed steel case is also really nice. I personally have this on an aftermarket blue leather strap.</p>

  <p>I absolutely love this watch. It's gorgeous, fits my wrist perfectly and is really old school. It just looks the business, especially with the blue face and Pepsi bezel. The only reason I haven't given it 5 stars is because the strap is a real hair puller.</p>

  <p>I hate this watch. It's almost impossible to see the hands against the face. The most annoying thing is that it looked more beige on the website, not this grey colour. I should have sent it back really. Anyone interested in buying it? 😂</p>

  <p>The Waterbury Ocean is made out of recycled ocean plastic. Because of that, it has this mottled effect to the plastic, which I think looks really cool. The strap is really comfortable on this watch, and because it's all plastic, it's really light.</p>

  <p>This is the *Camper* version of the *Expedition*, and it's another good watch that I wear regularly. Super cheap, relatively clear to read and a good backlight. It would have got 4 stars except for the fact that the standard strap on this thing is horrible. I swapped it for a NATO that matches the colours of the watch.</p>

  <p>I cannot quantify in words how epically bad this watch is. It tries to be a G-SHOCK and just fails. The screen is ok when you look at it directly, but as soon as there's any angle, you can't see shit. The plastic casing and buttons feel cheaper than the £15 F91-W, but it's 3x the price. Also, the strap has this stupid clip thing on the end that makes it almost impossible to remove. Don't waste £50 on this thing, get a DW-5600 instead for around the same money.</p>

  <p>Vostok is a Russian watchmaker who specialise in churning out very cheap mechanical watches, mostly for the Russian military. This is an *Amphibia* which is part of their vast range of divers. I've customised this by removing the rotating bezel and replacing it with a plain one.</p>

  <p>Another Vostok from the *Amphibia* line up. This one is again a customised version where I've replaced the default bezel with a Vostok aftermarket yellow bezel that matches the yellow accents on the dial. I've also added a custom black and yellow silicone strap.</p>

  <p>I received this as a Christmas gift from my kids last year. It's a really nice looking watch and the EcoDrive is solar powered, so should never need a new battery. It would have got 4 stars, but because the watch face is 43mm, it makes the 20mm strap look a bit...pathetic.</p>

  <p>This watch is probably the best looking watch I have in my collection (specifically, this is model number T0954101703701). I love the blue on the dial and bezel, as well as the pearlescent effect on the face. It's swiss made, has a sapphire crystal, and will probably last me forever. I love this thing.</p>

  <p>This is the most expensive watch in my collection, and it really shows. I love the vintage look and the waffle effeect on the dial. The brushed strap is a thing of pure beauty too. Only reason I've given this 4 stars instead of 5, is because of the custom straps you need for it. I bought the blue leather Tissot strap for this and it cost me nearly £50!</p>

  <p>Berny are a Chinese microbrand that create some great watches for not a lot of money. This thing is a big heavy beast of a watch, so certainly not for everyone. The orange face is really unique, and is covered with a sapphire crystal. It's running the tried and tested Miyota 8205 movement. Overall it's a lot of watch for the money. I'm running this on a custom silicone strap.</p>

  <p>This is another nice watch from Berny, although not as nice as the AM7091M in my opinion. The dial is super legible thanks to the high contrast and large size. I'm not a huge fan of the lollipop second hand, but I can live with that. Like the other Berny it has sapphire crystal and Myota movement, so should last a lifetime.</p>

  <p>The CWC G10 is a true field watch in every sense of the word. This particular watch is very special to my heart, as it's the watch I was issued in the British Army, back in 2005. So this watch is nearly 20 years old, it survived both Iraq and Afghanistan and is still going strong. I absolutely adore this watch.</p>

  <p>It's a close call between this watch and the MudMan as my favourite watch in my collection. It's a twist on the [Dirty Dozen watches](https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/dirty-dozen-twelve-military-watches) of the Second World War. I love everything about this watch - the dial, the case, the size, the hands. It's just beautiful. I have this on an aftermarket leather strap, which I think sets off the watch perfectly.</p>
